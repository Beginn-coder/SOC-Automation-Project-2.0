# SOC-Automation-Project-2.0
A Hands-on guide to building AI-driven SOC workflows with Splunk and n8n. Learn to set up VMs, ingest telemetry, create alerts, and automate responses to streamline detection and incident response.

## 📖 Overview
This project is inspired by the *“SOC Automation Project 2.0: How To Use AI in Your SOC Workflow”* video from MyDFIR. It provides scripts, documentation, and examples to help security professionals and learners replicate the project in their own environments.


## 🔑 Features
- **Splunk Setup & Telemetry**: Configure VMs, install Splunk, and send system telemetry for centralized monitoring.  
- **Alert Creation**: Build Splunk alerts that detect suspicious activity and trigger automated responses.  
- **Workflow Automation with n8n**: Connect Splunk alerts to automation pipelines, reducing manual triage.  
- **AI Integration**: Explore how AI can enhance SOC efficiency by analyzing alerts and prioritizing incidents.
