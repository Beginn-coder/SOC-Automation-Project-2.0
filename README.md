## Part 1: VM Setup

We're going to create 3 virtual machines: Windows 10, Splunk(SIEM), and n8n(SOAR). 
## 🖥️ Virtual Machine Configuration

| VM Name            | Role             | OS             | CPUs | RAM   | Disk Size        |
|--------------------|------------------|----------------|------|-------|------------------|
| Windows-10         | Victim/Endpoint  | Windows 10     | 2    | 4 GB  | 60 GB (default)  |
| Splunk             | SIEM             | Ubuntu Server  | 2    | 8 GB  | 100 GB           |
| N8N-VM             | SOAR/Automation  | Ubuntu Server  | 2    | 4 GB  | 50 GB            |


## ⚙️ VM Creation Steps

For each virtual machine:

1. Follow your hypervisor's **"New Virtual Machine" wizard**.  
2. Point the installer to the corresponding ISO (Windows or Ubuntu).  
3. Assign the resources as specified in the [VM Configuration Table](#🖥️-virtual-machine-configuration).  
4. Set the **Network Type** to **NAT** for all VMs.  
5. Power on the VMs to begin OS installation.

### A. Windows 10 (Windows-10)
1. Follow the Windows setup wizard.  
2. When prompted, select:
   - **"I don't have a product key."**
   - **Windows 10 Pro**
   - **Custom: Install Windows only**
3. During the initial setup (OOBE):
   - Set up for personal use → Offline account → Limited experience.  
   - Create a local user (e.g., `mydfir`) and set a password.  
   - Decline all privacy and telemetry options.  
4. Once at the desktop, enable Remote Desktop:
   - Start → *Remote desktop settings* → Toggle **Enable Remote Desktop** to **On**.  
5. Open `cmd` and get the VM’s IP address: ipconfig

Note: remember to take a Snapshot of the VM

Finally, take a snapshot of the Splunk VM and name it Splunk-installed.




## 📮 Part 3: Send Windows Telemetry to Splunk

### 1: Install Splunk Universal Forwarder
1. 	Copy the Splunk Universal Forwarder file from your host to the Windows 10 VM.
2. 	Run the installer inside the Windows 10 VM.
3. 	Follow the setup wizard:
   - Accept the license agreement.
   - Select Splunk Enterprise (on-premise).
   - Username:  (local user for the forwarder). Set a password.
   - Deployment Server: Leave blank.
   - Receiving Indexer:
     -	Host: Your mydfir-splunk VM IP
     -	Port: 9997
  - Click Next and Install.

### 2: Configure Data Inputs
1. On the Windows 10 VM, navigate to C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\system\local
2. Open notepad and create a new file
3. Head over to [inputs.conf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-qYp4oCrT1BqhG1oaprQfkFhgFIHiWEm/view) and copy the entire text to paste it into the notepad file, then save the file as inputs.conf under C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\system\local 
4. Run the Services app as admin (services.msc).
5. Find the SplunkForwarder service:
   - Right-click > Properties > Log On tab.
   - Select Local System account and click Apply.
   - Right-click the service and Restart.

### 3 Verify data in Splunk
1. Go back to your Splunk web interface and click on Search & Reporting.
2. In the search bar, type in index="mydfir-project" and set the time range to Last 24 hours

You should be able to see events from your Windows 10 VM

## 🤖 Part 4: Install n8n (Automation)

### 1: Install Docker and Docker Compose
1. SSH into your N8N-VM using it's ip address
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose using these commands:
   - sudo apt install docker.io -y
   - sudo apt install docker-compose -y

Troubleshooting note- If you get "fail to fetch" errors, you may need to edit your sources list:
- sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources
  - Find any lines with 'ir.archive.ubuntu.com' and remove the 'ir.' prefix.
  - Save (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter), then run 'sudo apt update' and try the installs again.
 
### 2: Creating the n8n Docker Compose File
1. Create a directory for your n8n configuration:
   - mkdir n8n-compose
   - cd n8n-compose
2. Create the docker-compose.yaml file by doing **sudo nano docker-compose.yaml** and then going to this link: [docker-compse.yaml](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aTPKp5VPLuC7QwdEdx8-qB70iIiTSYkU/view) and copying the entire text into the file

**Important**: Change the N8N_HOST value to your n8n VM's IP address.

3. Save and exit

### 3: Start n8n and Fix Permissions
1. Pull the n8n Docker image and start the container:
   - sudo docker-compose pull
   - sudo docker-compose up -d

**Troubleshooting note**: You may get a "Connection Refused" error in your browser due to a permissions issue. 

To fix this:
  - The 'n8n_data' volume is owned by 'root', but needs to be 'node' (UID 1000) so run:
     - sudo chown -R 1000 n8n_data
  - Restart the container with the correct permissions by running: 
     - sudo docker-compose down
     - sudo docker-compose up -d

2. On your host browser, go to **http://[your-n8n-vm-ip]:5678**
3. You should now see the n8n setup screen. Create your owner account to complete the installation.
4. Take a snapshot of the VM and name it n8n-installed.


## 🚨 Part 5: Create a Splunk Alert

### 1. Generate Brute Force Telemetry
1. From your Host Machine, open a Remote Desktop (RDP) connection to your Windows 10 VM IP and enter a random but incorrect password
2. Repeat this process 5 times to generate multiple Event ID 4625 logs

**Note**: If you are already logged in via RDP, you can just lock the screen and type wrong passwords, or try to RDP from a second window.

### 2. Analyze Logs in Splunk
1. Go to your Splunk Search & Reporting app and run the following query: **index="mydfir-project" EventCode=4625**
2. Verify you see the 5 failed events.
3. Refine the search to display a clean table of the data we need. Update the query to: index="mydfir-project" EventCode=4625 | stats count by _time, ComputerName, user, src_ip

   - _time: When it happened.
   - ComputerName: Which machine was targeted.
   - user: The fake username attempted.
   - src_ip: Where the attack came from.

### 3. Create the Alert
1. With the refined query running, click Save As > Alert.
2. Title: test-brute-force
3. Description: Detects failed login attempts.
4. Alert Type: Scheduled.
5. Run on Cron: Select Run on Cron Schedule and enter the following to run every minute (for testing purposes): * * * * *
6. Trigger Conditions: Trigger when Number of Results is Greater than 0.
7. Trigger Actions:

   - Click + Add Actions > Add to Triggered Alerts.
   - Click + Add Actions > Webhook.

We'll set up the webhook in the next part so leave the "Save As Alert" dialog box open

## 🔗 Part 6: Connect n8n to Splunk

### 1. Configure the n8n Webhook Node
1. Open your n8n interface in your browser (http://[your-n8n-vm-ip]:5678).
2. Click Start from scratch to create a new workflow.
3. Click Add first step and search for Webhook. Select it.
<img width="208" height="181" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4acabce-617a-4245-915f-ae118ae03c72" />

4. Configuration:

   - HTTP Method: Change this from GET to POST.
   - Path: You can leave this as default.
5. Copy URL: Locate the Test URL (it usually looks like http://.../webhook-test/...) and click to copy it.

<img width="540" height="910" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fe7f907-960b-438d-b405-3572add2eaaf" />


### 2. Update Splunk Alert
1. Navigate back to your Splunk tab.
2. If you still have the "Save As Alert" dialog open, paste the URL into the Webhook URL field.

**Note**: If you closed it: Go to Settings > Searches, reports, and alerts, find test-brute-force, click Edit > Edit Alert, and scroll down to the Trigger Actions section.

3. Paste the n8n Test URL into the text box and click save.
4. Click View Alert and ensure the status is set to Enabled.

### 3. Verify Data Reception
1. Go back to **n8n** and click on the **Listen for test event** button. 

**Note**: you may need to wait for a minute

Once the screen is updated, showing **"Workflow executed"**, you can Expand the JSON or Body section in the Output Data. You should see the telemetry fields we configured in Splunk:

- _time
- ComputerName
- user
- src_ip
- count

## 🧠 Part 7: Integrate OpenAI (ChatGPT)

### 1. Disable Splunk Alert (Temporarily)
1. Go to **Splunk > Searches, reports, and alerts** and find test-brute-force and click Edit > Disable. We don't want the alert firing every minute while we build the workflow
2. Go to n8n, check the execution history, open the last successful test, and click Pin Data on the Webhook node. This allows you to build the rest of the flow without needing to re-trigger Splunk constantly.

### 2. Add OpenAI Node
1. In n8n, click the + button and search for OpenAI.
2. Select Message a model.
3. Credential Setup:
    - Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)
    - Sign up/Log in and go to API Keys.
    - Create a new key.
    - In n8n, create a new credential and paste the key.
  
**Note**: You must have a small amount of credit (min $5) in your OpenAI billing settings for the API to work.

 4. Configuration:
     - Model: gpt-4o-mini (or your preferred model).
     - Messages:
       - Message 1 (Role: System): Format the output clearly. Return findings in a structured format such as: Summary, IOC Enrichment, Severity Assessment, and Recommended Actions.
       - Message 2 (Role: Assistant): Act as a Tier 1 SOC Analyst assistant. When provided with a security alert or incident details (including indicators of compromise, logs, or metadata), perform the                                                following steps:
                                                      1. Summarize the alert.
                                                      2. Enrich with threat intelligence.
                                                      3. Assess the severity based on MITRE ATT&CK.
                                                      4. Recommend next actions.
       - Message 3 (Role: User):
          
          - Drag the **Search Name** from the Webhook output into this field.
          - We also need the raw result details. Because the fields might change based on the alert type, use an expression to stringify the JSON.
          - Add the following expression to the user message: Alert Details: {{ JSON.stringify($json.result, null, 2) }}

5. Connect the Webhook node to the OpenAI node.
